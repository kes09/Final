        <h2 class="headline">Makeup Tips And Tricks</h2>
        <p>Whether you are a beginner or an expert, makeup tips and tricks always come in handy for a smooth experience and tackling accidents. For example, a simple trick can help you get the perfect wing design or cat eyes using an eyeshadow. You may be surprised that you can use the same eyeshadow palette to contour your cheekbones, fill your brows, or highlight the face. So, take a look at your cosmetic products and think about creating a masterpiece. A primer, foundation, blush, or color correcting palette — you can use each makeup product with some trick to appear flawless and elegant. Try out these genius makeup tips to get your best look. Keep reading to know more!</p>
        <h4>Make Sure Your Primer Complements Your Foundation</h4>
        <p>Whether oil or water, your primer and foundation should share the same base; otherwise, they will repel each other or just slide off your face, making it difficult to blend.</p>
        <h4>Right Application For Right Coverage</h4>
        <p>It is commonly believed that while putting your foundation on, if you want sheer coverage, you should use your fingers. But, if you want a full coverage, you should opt for a foundation brush. However, It is important to note that formula is key to achieving the kind of coverage you want, irrespective of the application style. Marin McCarthy remarks, “There are some amazing sheer coverage foundations such as Charlotte tilbury beautiful skin or a tinted spf that will likely not be able to build up to full coverage even with a brush.” She goes on to add, “ I find the best application for any foundation is to smooth over skin with fingers or a brush and then blend out any lines with a sponge.”</p>
        <h4>Avoid Peach Fuzz.</h4>
        <p>Always apply foundation using downward strokes. Most of us have a thin layer of hair on our face, and applying foundation in an upward stroke will make the hair strands stand out. However, even with perfect makeup, given the right light, peach fuzz will be visible. The best way is to remove facial hair. You can opt for derma planing or use a small facial razor with oil to remove peach fuzz and get a natural and perfect glow.</p>
        <h4>DIY Color Correcting Palette</h4>
        <p>You probably, by now, have heard about the wonder called color correcting palette. These concealers of various hues are used to cancel out flaws on your face. For example, a green concealer is used for canceling out any redness, lavender for yellow toned discolouration, peach for bruises or blue toned under eye circles, etc. But if you suddenly find yourself without your color correction palette or just want to save money, just mix an eyeshadow of the color you want your concealer to be with your normal concealer - and voila! You have your smart and cheap color corrector concealer palette. However, do note that mixing powder into a cream formula can change and thicken or dry out the concealer. Marin suggests an alternative to eyeshadow- lipstick!</p>
        <h4>Know The Important Focal Points</h4>
        <p>This hack is for those days when you are running late or just feeling too lazy to apply your concealer properly. Just dab on a little concealer, preferably with a brush, under your eyes, on the corners of your mouth, and near your nose, and you are good to go. As Marin McCarthy states, “Highlighting the center of your face is ideal.”</p>
        <h4>Choose The Right Brush</h4>
        <p>The result of any makeup product largely depends on the applicator, and this is especially true for powders. Always use the fluffiest brush you can find to put your powder on for best results.</p>
        <h4>Blush Under Foundation</h4>
        <p>This is also a clever way of reversing the order of applying the product to get smashing results. All you have to do is apply the blush first and then apply the foundation over it. The end result looks like you are glowing naturally from within. However, do make sure it is cream or liquid blush! Powder blush under foundation could cause patchiness.</p>
        <h4> Apply In A Triangular Fashion For Better Blending</h4>
        <p>Though it's a common practice to apply bronzer with a fluffy brush on the hollow of your cheeks, it is a better idea to draw two inverted triangles on your cheeks with a bronzer if you want to achieve cool-toned contouring. Blend it out, and you will have the perfectly done bronzer that will give you perfectly chiseled features. On the topic of bronzers, Marin comments, “Bronzers should be placed where the sun would hit the face, so the forehead, temples, middle of the cheeks (vertically) and optionally on the nose and chin. A great hack to bring the face together is to use your bronzer as eyeshadow in your crease.”</p>
        <h4>Instant Eye Lift</h4>
        <p>For an instant lift in the eyes, use your highlighter just above the arch of your brows and blend it out. It will not only define your eyebrows perfectly but also have a dramatic impact on the appearance of your entire face.</p>
        <h4>Proxy For Eyeliner</h4>
        <p>On the days when another battle with your eyeliner seems impossible or you just want a soft look, take an angular brush and use eyeshadow instead of an eyeliner on your upper lash line. It gives a natural and breezy look, absolutely perfect for summers.</p>
        <h4>Hassle Free Smokey Eyes</h4>
        <p>For a quick smokey eye, apply kohl on your upper and lower lashlines and waterline and then smudge it. Finish off by drawing a sideways 'V' on the outer corner and blend well. Rock the sultry smokey eyes for a night out</p>
